    \item In the post.hoc tests, the grouping of treatments are formed according to 
the probability of the difference between treatments and the alpha level.

friedman, HSD.test, kruskal, LSD.test, Median.test, PBIB.test, REGW.test, 
scheffe.test, SNK. Test, waller.test and waerden.test. Now there is good 
correspondence between the grouping and the pvalue.

treatment groups and their variation by range, interquartil range, 
Standard deviation and standard error.

    \item Updated documentation.

    \item procedure duncan.test is better, the limitations in convergence were corrected.
    \item The influence in AMMI (type=3) is relative neighbor graph as a sub-graph.
    \item The post hoc nonparametrics tests (kruskal, friedman, durbin and waerden) 
are using the criterium Fisher's least significant difference (LSD)
  }
}

    \item New function orderPvalue(). Grouping the treatments in a comparison with p.value minimum value (alpha)
    \item Test LSD.test and kruskal the adjust P.value (holm, hommel, hochberg, bonferroni, BH, BY, fdr). The comparison in pairs and groups give similar results.
  }

\section{Changes in version 1-1.9 (June 17, 2014)}{
  \itemize{
    \item PBIB new parameter: group=TRUE. PBIB.test(block,trt,replication,y,k, method=c("REML","ML","VC"), test = c("lsd","tukey"), alpha=0.05, console=FALSE, group=TRUE). When you have many treatments to use group=FALSE.
    \item design.rcbd(..., continue=FALSE). Continue=TRUE or FALSE, continuous numbering of plot.
    \item Median.test. New function for multiple comparisons of treatments with Median.
    \item Now, AMMI function checks the minimum number of environments and genotypes. Now use console=TRUE or FALSE to output in screen. the graphs are produced by 
the plot function.
    \item plot.AMMI() or plot() functions generate plot of the AMMI with others principal components. type=1 (biplot), type=2 (triplot) and type=3 (influence genotype)
    \item Changed parameters by default "first = TRUE" in designs: rcbd, ab, split and lsd.
    \item Now vignettes in agricolae.
    \item change name ogive.freq by ojiva.freq, the parameters are same.
    \item AUDPC the evaluation parameter  now can be numeric vector. To see help(audpc)
  }

\section{Changes in version 1-1.8 (February 21, 2014)}{
  \itemize{
    \item zigzag(outdesign). The new function applied to designs: rcbd, lsd, graeco, split, strip, ab, alpha, bib, cyclic, lattice, dau. The outdesign is the output book the function design.###(). The function zigzag change the order number plots in serpentine form.
    \item Now, all design functions have two output objects: parameters and book, the parameters contain initial values that will allow reproduce the design and book contain field book.
    \item Now, all design functions have two output objects: parameters and book, the parameters contain initial values that will allow reproduce the design and book contain field book.
    \item The alpha and lattice designs have additionally two objects: statistics and field sketches.
    \item BIB have the statistics
